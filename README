I have put the project package in the repo...
You just have to create the layout file as per the following specification and create the layout....
Name the Introduction layout as "About Us".
         Contact details as "Contact Us"
         Upcoming project layout as "Upcoming Projects"
         Projects as "Projects"
As of now we will not include any News and Blog until they are created.....



I am keeping the project files..Add your layout name in the strings array which corresponds to the navigation slider and also create the layout 
and onclick activity for it...
